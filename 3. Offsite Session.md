The purpose of the offsite is to prepare a strategic plan. The day will be focused on aligning your entire team around a plan that you can execute over the coming 12 months. 

Here is some additional information on what to expect during the day. 

<b>Getting the team together</b>
We will be working in PNR’s platform (available here) - look out for an email invitation to join your company account.
The platform is very user-friendly, but don’t worry, one of the PNR team members will moderate the day’s session anyways. 

<b>Choosing potential objectives/goals to achieve during the year (Candidate Epics)</b>

At this point, we are brainstorming your objectives and will end up with a list of 5-20 objectives; at this stage, the more, the better. 
Examples of Epics: Create a product team, Transition to a SaaS model, Open an office in New York, etc.
The idea is to stay high level with objectives that will take the whole year to achieve and to avoid listing short-term projects. If several projects help you achieve one broad objective, list the latter.

<b>Discussion on the Market Landscape (your company’s threats and opportunities) </b>
We will create a list of threats that are external to your company and that may put you at risk in the coming year (examples include: a change in legislation, new competitors entering your market, suppliers no longer supporting you).
We will also create a list of opportunities that you can capitalize on in the coming year (examples include: new consumer segments and new technologies that you can leverage).  

<b>Organizational Introspection </b>
The purpose is to realign the team on major goals and to reveal the tools at your disposal to achieve your long term vision.
We will be discussing your Yearly Revenue, Yearly Profit, Dividends and Cash on Hand objectives. 
We will also list your company values, purpose, BHAG (10-year goal) and your USP (unique selling proposition). 



<b>Finalizing the Objectives (Final Epics) </b>
Now that we have identified potential objectives and taken into account our threats, opportunities and goals, we can finalize the objectives we want to achieve for the year. 
We go back to the original list of 5-20 objectives and narrow it down to the top 3 to 5 that we can realistically achieve and rank them in order of priority. This step is important because when running out of time and resources, you should always focus on completing tasks related to your most important objectives. 

<b>Creating Tasks, assigning Effort and Prioritizing </b>

This portion will take approximately half a day and here is what to expect for each portion of it. We will be essentially deconstructing what needs to be done to optimize your chances of realizing your 3 to 5 epics into smaller steps.

<b>Creating the Task list (Backlog Creation)</b>

We will create the task list for every epic. Don’t worry about when an item needs to be done - it is enough to know that it needs to be achieved in the next year. 
All the items we create have to be achievable within one sprint (approximately one month), so we often create multiple tasks for a single, large project. For example, launching a new website takes longer than a month, so we will create multiple tasks as follows: 
Choose agency for website development;
Design the website; 
Code, test and launch the website; 
Prepare and launch a marketing campaign for the new website. 
All tasks must apply the S.M.A.R.T principle (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-Bound); in other words, write them out clearly so that everyone can remember what the task is a few months down the line. 
Don’t worry about coming out with the list for the full year; the process we are going through is iterative: we will review this list every month and, as things evolve in your organization, we can either remove items that are no longer relevant, or add other ones. 
Don’t add any items that are part of regular operations. For example: 
Good backlog item: Set up a formal process to share info between marketing and sales; 
Bad backlog item: have a bi-weekly meeting between sales and marketing (this is not a good backlog item because this task can never be completed - it is an ongoing activity).  

<b> Determining the Effort of each Backlog item (Weight Voting) </b>

This session will have us voting on the effort required to complete a task.
A few things you need to know: 
Everyone votes on their own laptop or tablet so that we don’t influence each other. 
Once all the votes are in, one of two things will happen: 
We are all somewhat in agreement on the effort of a task: the vote passes and we vote for the next item; 
We have wildly diverging opinions on the effort required to complete a task; then the platform will stop us and ask us to discuss as a group so that we may reach a consensus; 
Voting is on an exponential scale of 2 to 13, following the Fibonacci sequence because humans tend to exponentially underestimate the actual effort required for larger tasks. A task that is rated a 2 is quick to execute and simple; a task that is ranked a 13 is complex and time-consuming (but still under a sprint!). 

<b>Determining the priority of each Backlog item (Priority Voting) </b>

This session will typically have the CEO or the most senior person in the room determining the priority of each item - it is still important for the team to discuss the priority of items if they disagree with their CEO.
