<b> Achieve Business Agility </b>
Welcome to Point of No Return, the leader in Agile Strategic Planning. 

This one pager explains how to run through the Agile Strategic Planning platform.

<b> Gather your team </b>
Close Facebook. Shut off Slack. Itâ€™s time to get serious. Gather your team over a one or two day offsite session and invite everyone to log into the platform. 

<b> Company Epics</b>
Describe the desired state of your organisation by the end of the planning period from a strategy perspective.

<b> Market Landscape </b>
Generate insightful discussions about your industry. You should discuss opportunities and 
threats your company needs to be prepared for.

<b> Introspection </b>
Dive into everything that is internal to the business, from financial capabilities to brand promise and values.

<b> Creation of backlog </b>
Reverse engineer what needs to be done to optimize your chances of realizing your epics. The rules are simple: Backlog items must be achievable in one sprint, and must apply the S.M.A.R.T principle.
Item prioritization (1 to 5)
Item effort weight (exponential scale 1 to 13)

<b> Sprint Planning </b>
Sprints are timeboxed effort containers (generally one month) for which each team member will voluntarily commit to accomplishing a set number of backlog items. 
Track your velocity as a team, learn from past mistakes, get better, repeat.
