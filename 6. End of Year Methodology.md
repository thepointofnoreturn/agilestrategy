<b>Achieve Business Agility</b>
Welcome to Point of No Return, the leader in Agile Strategic Planning. 

This one pager explains how to run through the End of Year process.

<b>Gather your team</b>
Close Facebook. Shut off Slack. It’s time to get serious. Gather your team over a one or two day offsite session and invite everyone to log into the platform. 

<b>Review last year - Sprint review</b>
Discuss and close items that are fully completed. If not, the items will be pushed to next year.

Review last year - Confirm epics</b>
Discuss and close epics that are fully completed. If not, it will be pushed to next year so that you can decide to include it or not in your next strategic plan.

<b>Review last year - Financial review</b>
Enter your financial results in order to compare your projections. Don’t wait on your official report, answer as best you can.

<b>Review last year - Final overview</b>
The year is now closed, take the time to analyse your performance in order to improve for next year.

<b>Company Epics</b>
Describe the desired state of your organisation by the end of the planning period from a strategy perspective.

<b>Market Landscape</b>
Generate insightful discussions about your industry. You should discuss opportunities and 
threats your company needs to be prepared for.

<b>Introspection</b>
Dive into everything that is internal to the business, from financial capabilities to brand promise and values.


<b>Creation of backlog</b>
Reverse engineer what needs to be done to optimize your chances of realizing your epics. The rules are simple: Backlog items must be achievable in one sprint, and must apply the S.M.A.R.T principle.
Item prioritization (1 to 5)
Item effort weight (exponential scale 1 to 13)

<b>Sprint Planning</b>
Sprints are timeboxed effort containers (generally one month) for which each team member will voluntarily commit to accomplishing a set number of backlog items. 
Track your velocity as a team, learn from past mistakes, get better, repeat.
