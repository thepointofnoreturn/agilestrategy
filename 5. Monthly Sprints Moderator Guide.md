<b>Before the Sprint Review</b>
Make sure all participants are invited to the platform.
To close a Sprint, on the top right, at the left of your name, click on the gear icon and then on “End Now”.

<b>During the Sprint Review</b>
Lobby
Click on “I’ll Moderate”.
Make sure all participants are connected to the platform (Green dot on their profile).
Click on “Start Now” at the top of the page when you are ready.

<b>Confirm Items from the last sprint</b>
One team member at a time, go over each action item and choose the proper state:
Mark the item as completed if the owner can demonstrate it was really done; or
Push the item to the next sprint if the item is still relevant; or
Push the item to the backlog if the item is no longer relevant for the next sprint.

<b>Parking Lot</b>
Review each item in the parking lot; either:
Delete if not relevant; or
Leave as-is; or
Assign them to an Epic if you want to add the item to the backlog.

<b>Backlog Grooming</b>
Go over each epic and ask yourself “what new information do we have which could have an impact on this objective” and make the necessary adjustments.
Make sure that all action items are still relevant and to be completed.
Add, delete or re-word backlog items according to the updated context of the company.

<b>Set Weight</b>
Discuss the effort of each new item (if any) and assign an effort to each item. Effort is ranked from 1 to 13, with 13 being the highest.
Now is also the time to change the effort of an existing item if new information has had an impact on the effort necessary to complete that item.

<b>Assign Priority</b>
Discuss the priority of each new item (if any) and assign a priority from 1 to 5, 1 being all “urgent & important” items.
Now is also the time to change the priority of an existing item if new information has had an impact on the priority of that item within the larger scope of the organisation.

<b>Next Sprint Planning</b>
Determine the planned end date and time of your sprint.
Assign backlog items to team members, on a voluntary basis to start with, then based on CEO’s judgment if there’s a conflict.
If this is not your first sprint, have a look at the last sprint velocity as well as your average velocity as a team, and try to improve. A team should constantly be pushing for increased execution velocity, while avoiding the pitfalls of overcommitment.
Start new sprint.
