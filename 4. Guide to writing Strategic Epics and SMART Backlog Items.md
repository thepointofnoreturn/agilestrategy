<b>GUIDE TO WRITING STRATEGIC EPICS </b>
Sometimes it’s hard to differentiate between strategic and operational goals.  

That’s a common question during strategic planning sessions because they are different for each company and can even transform from strategic to operational over time depending on the stage and maturity of the business. Here are a few tips on how to differentiate both and make the most of your strategic planning session:


<b>STRATEGIC</b>
Strategic goals focus on transforming the business.



Questions you are asking yourself when thinking about strategic goals:

Where do we want to go with this business? What can strengthen our positioning?
What are the problems we are trying to solve and how will we do that better than anyone else?
What are the strengths or weaknesses we need to work on?
How must our business look, act, and feel like in order for it to compete successfully in the changing markets?

These goals affect the company as a whole to survive and grow in its industry, market or customer base. They’re above and beyond what each department needs to deliver on a day-to-day basis. Think about strategic goals as new actions to take that influence the direction of the company.

<b>OPERATIONAL</b>
Operational goals focus on running the business.

Generating income, along with all of the operational, financial, and management tasks that will support that are operational goals. They include interacting with customers, manufacturing your product, delivering your service, preparing and reviewing financial reports, keeping your facilities functional, training and supporting employees, and more.

These goals usually belong to a specific department and are set and reviewed every year. Think about operational goals as optimizations or improvements on actions already implemented and processized.


GUIDE TO WRITING SMART BACKLOG ITEMS
Not sure about your backlog items and would like some guidance? Don’t sweat, here’s some tips on how to write SMART backlog items. 
First, let’s start with an example:
 


<b>Specific </b>    

Consider who, what, when, where, why and how in developing the goal.
Original: Provide a good service to customers 
What’s wrong with it? It’s not very clear about what service we are talking about and how we are going t0o do this. Are we targeting the customer support team and their time to respond to requests or store staff NPS scores, or number of complaints on social media platforms.

<b>Measurable </b>  

Include a numeric or descriptive measurement.


Better: Reduce complaints in stores by matching our competitors product purchase and return policies. 
What’s wrong with it? We can’t tell how much it has to improve by and therefore won’t be able to strive towards achieving it.

<b>Achievable</b>  

Consider the resources needed and set a realistic goal.
Better: Reduce complaints in stores by 50% by matching our competitors product purchase and return policies.
What’s wrong with it? Well we are not sure if this is reasonable. Our complaints levels are high and we need serious changes in our customer service approach that will take time and a lot of resources before seeing results.

<b>Relevant</b> 

Make sure the goal is consistent with the mission.
Better: Reduce complaints in stores by 10% by matching our competitors product purchase and return policies. 
What’s wrong with it? It has to be aligned with our company’s overarching objectives. Is this where we need to focus on this year and does it move the needle and support our strategy. If we believe that customer service is number one, then matching our competitors is not enough.

<b>Time-bound</b>

Set a realistic deadline.
Better: Reduce complaints in stores by 10% by providing better purchase and return policies than our competitors.
What’s wrong with it? We don’t know when this needs to be done. It needs to be time-boxed to have an impact on the team and allow them to distribute the effort needed over a period.

<b>SMART</b>
Final: By the end of the year, we will reduce complaints in stores by 10% by providing better purchase and return policies than our competitors.


SMART checklist :

When reading your item, can you imagine how it looks like when it’s done? Does everyone understand the final result the same way?
Can you easily tell if it’s done or not done? Would someone else be able to tell that it’s complete?
Are there available resources to achieve the item? Are there any time or money constraints that need to be considered? 
Do you understand the impact of this item on the business objective? Is it a priority?
Do you know when this needs to be done by? Is there a deadline?

And some more examples of SMART backlog items:
Increase our active members online registrations by 25% through better incentives and marketing tactics by Q3.
